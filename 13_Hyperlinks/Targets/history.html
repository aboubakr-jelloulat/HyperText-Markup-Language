  <h1>GNU/Linux — A Short History</h1>
  <p>In 1983 Richard Stallman launched the GNU project to create a free Unix-like operating system; GNU stands for "GNU's Not Unix."</p>
  <p>Stallman and the Free Software movement promoted software freedom: the rights to use, study, modify and share code.</p>
  <p>GNU developed many essential tools (compilers, shells, libraries) but lacked a kernel for years.</p>
  <p>In 1991 Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel; when combined with GNU tools it formed a complete OS—often called "GNU/Linux."</p>
  <p>The mentality behind GNU/Linux is collaboration, transparency, and preserving users' freedoms via licenses like the GPL (copyleft).</p>
  <p>Today many communities and distributions build on these ideas, balancing practical needs with ethical principles.</p>
  <p>GNU/Linux powers servers, desktops, phones and embedded systems—showing how shared work scales globally.</p>
  <p>Its story is still active: people worldwide contribute, debate, and improve both code and the culture of free software.</p>
