        <!-- About 42 Network -->
        <p>
            Created in 2013 by Xavier Niel, a successful French serial entrepreneur, 
            42 has now become an international reference for students and companies.

        <p>
            Since then, the best computer programming school in the world* has trained 
            thousands of professionals, to help eliminate the shortage of digital talents 
            while addressing economic and technological mutations, thanks to the quality 
            of its unanimously recognized education.
        </p>

            Entirely free and open to all talents, regardless of diplomas, origin, gender 
            and age, 42 is also an innovative social lab engaged in building the society 
            of tomorrow, a community that we hope will be more inclusive, caring, and supportive.

            At the crossroads between digital, jobs, and diversity, 42 shares its innovative 
            educational vision (peer learning), its know-how and its values (gratuity, 
            accessibility, neutrality, etc.) to create a global innovation hub.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Without registration or tuition fees</strong>, the selection of students
