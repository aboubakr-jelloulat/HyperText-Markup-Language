    <h1>Understanding the Rel Attribute</h1>
    <p>Here are some examples of the rel attribute in use:</p>
    
    <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Visit      Ericsson (External, No Follow)
    </a>


<!-- Common Values for the rel Attribute
Here are some of the most commonly used values for the rel attribute in <a> tags:

1- nofollow:

Usage: Instructs search engines not to follow the link for crawling and indexing.
Purpose: Often used for user-generated content or paid links to prevent endorsing or passing credibility to the target page.

2-noopener:

Usage: Prevents the new page from accessing the window.opener property and ensures it runs in a separate process.
Purpose: Enhances security and performance, particularly important when using target="_blank" to open a new tab.

3-noreferrer:

Usage: Same as noopener but also prevents the HTTP referer header from being sent to the new page.
Purpose: Useful for privacy to ensure that the destination site does not receive information about the source site.

4-external:

Usage: Indicates that the link leads to an external website.
Purpose: More semantic, informing both users and search engines that the link is external (though not widely used for behavioral control). -->
