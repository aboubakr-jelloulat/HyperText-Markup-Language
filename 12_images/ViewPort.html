	Without the viewport meta tag, the page looks very zoomed out on phones.

	<!--  On a phone, the text will look very small, and the page will be zoomed out	-->

	Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
	Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br>
	when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, 
	<br> but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
	<br> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
	<br> and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

  <p>You will have to zoom in to read this text clearly.</p>

	What is <meta name="viewport" ...>?

		This tag tells the browser how to display your page on different screen sizes, especially on phones and tablets

		name="viewport" → tells the browser this tag controls the page’s visible area.

		width=device-width → sets the page width to be the same as the device’s screen width.

		initial-scale=1.0 → sets the zoom level to 100% (no zoom in or out).


		initial-scale=1.0

			tells the browser:
			“Show the page at its real size — don’t zoom in or out.”

			you can use :
				initial-scale=2.0   ==>  zoomed in (everything looks bigger)
				initial-scale=0.5	==> zoomed out (everything looks smaller)
