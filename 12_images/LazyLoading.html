<!--
	The loading="lazy" attribute in HTML is a native browser feature that enables lazy loading of images and iframes


	This functionality is crucial for improving page load times, reducing resource consumption, 
	and enhancing user experience by deferring the loading of non-critical, 
	off-screen resources until they are needed



	Lazy Loading: Lazy loading is a design pattern aimed at delaying the initialization 
	or loading of resources until they are actually needed.



		How It Works ?

	When an <img> or <iframe> element includes the loading="lazy" attribute, 
	the browser will not load the resource when the page initially loads.Instead, 
	it will wait until the user scrolls near the place where the element is located. 
	This helps in reducing initial page load time, saves bandwidth, and improves the performance of the webpage





	Use loading="lazy" for images and iframes that are below the fold.
	•Ensure that critical images that appear above the fold are not lazy-loaded, as this could delay their visibility.
	•Use loading=“lazy” for:
		•For images that are rarely viewed by users.
		•For images in a hidden tab.
		•For images that appear at the bottom of the webpage.
