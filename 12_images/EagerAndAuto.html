<!--	

	The loading attribute has three possible values :
		* lazy: This value tells the browser to delay loading the element until it reaches a calculated distance from the viewport, 
			thereby prioritizing visible content
		
		* eager: Forces the browser to load the element immediately, regardless of where it appears on the page

		* auto: The browser uses its default loading strategy. 
			This could involve immediate loading as soon as the element is parsed (similar to the traditional behavior without lazy loading), 
			or it might incorporate some optimizations based on the user's connection speed, browser settings, and other fac




	Best Practices:

		•Use loading="eager" for critical images that are in the first viewport or near the top of the page.
		•Apply loading="lazy" to images and iframes that are below the fold or not immediately necessary.
		•Test your webpage's performance with different loading strategies to find the optimal setup for your content and audience

	



		loading="auto" ?? 

			loading="auto" leaves the decision up to the browser's loading algorithm, 
			which might not always implement lazy loading.
