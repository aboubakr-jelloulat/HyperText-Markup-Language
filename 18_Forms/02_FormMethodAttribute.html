<!-- 

The method attribute of an HTML form dictates how the browser sends the form data to the server. 
	It determines whether to use GET or POST, the two most commonly used HTTP methods for sending form data.

	The HTTP Methods
		GET:
			Description: Data is appended to the URL as a query string and visible to anyone. 
				It has a length limitation and should not be used for sensitive information.
			Use Cases: Suitable for form submissions where the data does not include sensitive information, 
				such as search filters or query parameters.


		POST:
			Description: Data is sent through the HTTP header, so the information is not displayed in the URL. 
				This method allows sending large quantities of data and is secure for sensitive information.
			Use Cases: Ideal for updating data, sending sensitive information (like passwords), 
				and for any form that results in a change of state or data manipulation on the server.

		
		How does the POST method enhance the security of form data?
			By including data in the request body, not the URL
